# fennel.vim

Vim highlighting and general syntax support for [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org), heavily modified from vim-clojure-static.

**Note:** This is a fork of [bakpakin/fennel.vim](https://github.com/bakpakin/fennel.vim)
that is now maintained separately, as the original is no longer being maintained.
Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for all updates post-fork. For now, this
primarily consists of updates accounting for newer Fennel releases.

## Install

Should work with the usual installation methods.
